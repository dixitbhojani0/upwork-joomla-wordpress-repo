# upwork-joomla-wordpress-repo
I'm using siteground as my hosting and you'll get the credentials to that where you'll be setting up Joomla and Wordpress and publish my already built local website.  The task is to edit Joomla's default template and then needs to match my local website which is done already.  Also needs to be done the same way with Wordpress.
